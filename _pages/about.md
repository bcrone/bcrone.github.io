Hello! I am a bioinformatics scientist with a **Ph.D. in Bioinformatics** from the **University of Michigan**. I completed my dissertation in 2024 titled "Computational Methods in Polygenic Risk Score Models" under the mentorship of [Dr. Alan P. Boyle](http://boylelab.org/people/Alan_Boyle) in the [Boyle Lab](http://boylelab.org/). My interests include gene regulation, functional variant analysis, software development, and analysis pipeline automation. I am currently open to new staff and research scientist opportunities both in academia and industry.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as an **Application Programmer** in the Bioinformatics Core at the **[Iowa Institute of Human Genetics](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/humangenetics/)**. In this role, I developed NGS analysis pipelines for both clinical and research applications in close collaboration with faculty stakeholders. I was a member of the development team for the [Deafness Variation Database](https://deafnessvariationdatabase.org/), a comprehensive guide to genetic variation in genes associated with deafness. Previously, I was a **Software Engineer** for the **Advanced Biomedical Informatics Group, LLC**, where I was a member of the data management team for the [PREDICT-HD study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000222.v3.p2). 

I received a dual **Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics** from the **University of Iowa**. My primary interests included linear and matrix algebra, numerical analysis, and mathematical optimization techniques. Outside of research, I enjoy activities outdoors, including running, hiking, and biking.
